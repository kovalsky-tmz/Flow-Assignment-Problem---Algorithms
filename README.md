# Flow-Assignment-Problem---Algorithms
Minimizing costs Flow Assignment problem in network is problem, which can be solved by linear programming. For optimalization I used 3
algorithms: linear and 2 metaheuristics - tabu search, list search.

I assume, that input data are uploaded to simulator from .xlsx file. User creates network with data (WEIGHTS, matrix of the
introduced intensities - REQ, capacities - CAPA, link cost - COSTS. Additionaly, user has to enter the number of nodes - NODES.

IMPORTANT!
Simulator is using plotly to generate charts, so you have to sign up https://plot.ly/Auth/login/?action=signup#/ and enter your username and API KEY (from account setting on webiste) after run app.
